**Home page of Kocio≈Çek - buffet and cafe in Bydgoszcz, Poland.**

This website was created for Kocio≈Çek company from scratch. I designed it by myself, including layout, colors, typography and overall appearance, as well as implemented some simple JS solutions. It is fully responsive and mobile-ready.
